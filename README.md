# Note Padd
QHack 2017 hack

What happens when you throw 3 Carleton students into a 36 hour hackathon with a Waterloo student? For us, it was Note Padd (tripple entendre - can you find all 3 meanings?), a web application that takes text and composes a song from it.

The idea was pitched as a interesting way of exploring natural language processing that incorporates a staff of programming and design principles. Note Padd parses english text and considers sentence length, punctuation, and syllables to create a song unique to the text. The option of using a major or minor scale is also presented to the user.

The project was a interesting challenge to our team which was both achievable and fun.
